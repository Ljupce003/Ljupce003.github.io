        <h2>Coding Skills</h2>
        <p>During my middle school I had learned basic machine code.I was introduced to C++ form which I learned the basics.
            In later years I started learning pascal,and to sum with middle school I started learning and programming in Delphi.</p>
        <br>
        <p>At Finki my knowledge was dramatically and exponentially increased.I started programming more advanced in C++ and on similar level also in C.
            After that I was introduced to HTML and CSS which are semantic languages for creating and styling web pages.
            I just finished first year at Finki, and I am ready for more knowledge and to increase my language library adn improve my coding skills. </p>

    <h3>Multimedia and Electrical knowledge</h3>
    <p>Technical problems and needs for having better performance on my computer made me more experienced with dealing problems on computers.
        From that I can independently fix my or someone else's computer.I also wanted to edit style and improve photos and videos, so I took upon myself to learn photoshop and video editing.
    From my father I also learned to do electricians work on homes and home appliances.</p>
